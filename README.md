## Usage

### Handling Asynchronous Operations with Promises

RoSocial uses Promises to manage asynchronous operations, such as fetching data or making API calls. Promises simplify error handling and chaining of asynchronous tasks. Hereâ€™s how you can integrate Promises into your usage of RoSocial:

#### Example: Fetching Friends List

```lua
-- Example using Promises to fetch a player's friends list

local RoSocial = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.RoSocial)

local friends = RoSocial:GetFriends(game.Players.astromaticly)

friends:andThen(function(friendslist)
	print(friendslist)
end):catch(warn)
```
